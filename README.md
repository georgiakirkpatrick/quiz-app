## About the project

"What Are You Wearing?" was created in 2019 as project for my Bloc (now Thinkful) Full-Stack Engineering bootcamp. The requirements for the project were to create a responsive quiz using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.  This was a solo project which I completed with occasional help from a mentor.

I drew on my professional background to create this quiz. Before I joined a software engineering bootcamp, I earned a biology degree with a focus on environmental conservation and additional studies in economics, conducted research of smallholder cotton farms in Peru, and founded a mission-based clothing brand, Silvania. My background in the fashion industry and interest in sustainability shaped the content of this quiz.

I consulted several sources to write the content of this quiz. These can be found in [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgments).

## Getting started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of "What Are You Wearing?" up and running.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

Update [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about) to their latest versions if you have not already.  For information about current versions of Node.js and npm, see the [Node Release Schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).

  ```
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
