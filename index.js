        question: `Modal, lyocell, tencel, acetate, and viscose are all variants of which cellulose-based fiber developed in 
        France in the 1890s?`,
        options: [
            'Spandex',

            'Rayon'
        ],
        answer:'Rayon',
        explanation: `Rayon, modal, lyocell, tencel, acetate, and viscose are all considered semi-synthetic fibers. While they 
        are made with natural plant materials such as wood pulp, their production involves harmful chemicals like carbon disulfide.`,

        question: `Studies have shown that synthetic fibers release microplastics when washed. Microplastics are very 
        small pieces of plastic that pollute the environment. Which of the following fibers do NOT contribute to 
        microplastic pollution?`,
        options: [
            'Spandex',
            'Polyester',
            'Nylon',
            'Rayon'],
        answer: 'Rayon',
        explanation: `Rayon is made of plant-based cellulose while spandex, polyester, and nylon are all forms of plastic. 
        A scientific-study by Plymouth University measured how many fibres are released during washing synthetic fabrics.  
        They found that each garment in a load of laundry can shed more than 1,900 fibers of microplastics. For an average 
        wash load of 6 kg, over 700,000 fibres could be released per wash.`,

        answer: 'Modal',
        explanation: `Modal is a type of rayon that is stronger and lighter than standard rayon.  
        Modal is plant-based while nylon, spandex, and polyester are made of petrochemicals.`,

            'Acetate',
            'Viscose'],
        answer: 'Tencel',
        explanation: `Although tencel, modal, acetate, and viscose fibers are made from plants, they all rely on harmful 
        chemicals in their manufacturing processes. Only tencel is made in a closed-loop production process so that a 
        minimal amount of harmful chemicals are emmitted.`,

            'Wool',
            'Modal'],
        answer: 'Wool', 
        explanation: `Wool fibers are covered in cuticle cells that have a waxy coating, making wool water-repellent.  Tiny pores in
        the cuticle cells allow water vapor to pass through the wool fiber.  When wool absorbs moisture, it retains warmth.  For example, if you go from a warm room into a cold, damp night wearing a wool jersey, the wool picks up water vapor from the air, keeping you warm.  The reverse occurs when you go back into the warm room â€“ the moisture in your jersey
        passes into the atmosphere, cooling you down.`,
